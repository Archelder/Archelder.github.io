        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the April Foolâ€™s Day, have you been lied? Or did you lied to someone? It is said that someone may tell a truth under the cover of lies. Exempli gratia one might confessing their love to the long-time crush. Once refused, this turns to a lie in a natural way. The confessor might get a chance to avoid an embarrassing situation and continue to pursue in a secret way. Some might take this for a joke, but what is grief if not love persevering?</p><p>If someone said it is a lie, it is a lie then. Have fun but do not fool yourself.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Archelder/images@main/IMG_2304.jpeg" alt="IMG_2304"></p>]]></content>
